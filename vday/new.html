    The meet-<br>
    When we met I was in a bad situation that I couldn’t 
    figure out how to resolve. I was wait someone I couldn’t grow with 
    let alone raise a family with. 
    And a relationship that wasn’t going anywhere.. I wasn’t looking for another relationship, 
    I just needed a friend. You came at the perfect time. <br><br>
    </p>

        <span>Late 2020</span><br><br>
        My dad suddenly passed and you were the one who was constantly checking on me and making sure 
        I had my vitamins and food because I was neglecting my physical and mental health at the time. 
        When I was with you I was able to process my emotions at a slower pace than what was always expected 
        from me. and just having someone listening to me meant the world. I lost my best friend and gained one 
        all in the same year.<br><br>

        <span>Our Walks</span><br><br>
        As we got closer our walks helped me a lot. Being outside and most importantly being 
        with someone who mattered and who was actually listening. I felt like I can actually 
        just take my time and breathe.

        <span>2021</span><br><br>
        I Quit my job because I wasn’t happy, you were the one who encouraged me to do whatever makes me happy. 
        Without you I wouldn’t have financially been able to quit my job and start over. I was scared. I felt 
        like a failure. My ego was broken but none of that mattered . You were in my corner with every decision.

        Interlude-
        You’re so good with cam , so patient, and so involved. I know it’s hard to keep boundaries and being present at the same time. We both love you for that. <br><br>

        <span>2023</span><br><br>
        The future_
        every time I ask for something you would go out and get it for me even if that means putting aside what you are currently doing. You Never complain. I’m trying to be more like you in that aspect. I’m trying to get better at explaining how I feel to you. I figured this would be a perfect opportunity. you make every holiday special. You try so hard for us. Thank you for everything you do.
